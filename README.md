Lesson on Naive Bayes classification or SVM

This Jupyter Notebook is a (pending) practical mini project to apply Naive Bayes or SVM in the context of astronomical classification.
This project is currently in pause and will be updated with better results. My initial goal was to learn for myself by explaining what I understood, so I will come back with new fresh ideas after I graduate my Machine Learning degree !
